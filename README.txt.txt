The fractal terrain is generated using the Diamond Square Algorithm, which places
the values into a two dimensinal height map. Our algorithm is iterative rather than
recursive, which involves using modulo operators to wrap values on the edges. With the
heightmap values, the vertex normals are generated by adding surface normals to each
vertex and then normalizing.

The values are then used to generate a triangle mesh in the BuildVertexArray method,
along with the water plane. The triangle mesh has two sides so that it can be viewed
from underneath. The sun is generated in a different file that inherits from 
ColoredGameObject, and basic effect lighting is used and matches the rotation
speed of the sun to simulate day and night.
